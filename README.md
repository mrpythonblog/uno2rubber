# Uno2Rubber By [Hossein Ahmadi] :)

today , i will show you my new tool .

Uno2Rubber , is a tool for make a hacking board for you . it can convert your arduino uno board to a RubberDucky .

you can run a custom BatchFile (.bat file) on target  using this RubberDucky

by default , the uno board can't support HID Classes . so we can't make a RubberDucky using that . but this tool can solve this problem .
uno2rubber changes the standard firmware of your uno board . so your board can act as a RubberDucky .

but after changing the standard firmware of your board , you can't use from your uno borad for making your normal projects . 
uno2rubber can flash standard firmware of your board , so you can making your normal projects :) 

----------HOW TO USE------------------

1 - install uno2rubber . run -> "chmod +x install.sh ; sudo ./install.sh"

2 - Execute Script -> "python3 uno2rubber.py"

3 - you can select your custom option in script . Enjoy :)
